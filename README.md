# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis
#  Description
Nowaday, Twitter have become an important part of the daily life of many of users. This
microblogging services are used as communication media, recommendation services, real-time
news sources and information sharing sites. The large amount of new data created as result makes
automatic analysis essential for processing this data. Thus, Twitter has become an attractive area
for many studies such as text classification. Social media has become a common place where
people manifest their opinions. Through sentiment analysis, companies can automatically process
what their consumers write in natural language and get valuable insights in order to take decisions.
Text classification aims at labeling natural language texts into a fixed number of predetermined
categories.


Pre-processing

● Text cleaning 
Tweets contain different kind of noise that can harm machine learning algorithms /n
performance. We need to carefully get rid of them. To this particular task we will take advantage
of regular expressions. 

● Spelling correction 
People make typos (‘cudtomers’ ), use abbreviations (‘ppl’), acronyms (‘asap’) and
different words have the same meaning (‘iphone’ and ‘phone’). These are just four examples of
words that need to be fixed. This examples were found by inspecting the frequency vocabulary.
For bigger datasets or automated processing spell checker can be used 

● NLTK features 
Baseline preprocessing methods. For example wordnet corpus to find out the senses of
different words if needed.
